#Java Bean
JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). 

A Java Bean is a java class that should follow following conventions:

    It should have a no-arg constructor.
    It should be Serializable.
    It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties, known as getter and setter methods.

#Why use Java Bean?
According to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. 
A bean encapsulates many objects into one object, so we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, 
it provides the easy maintenance.

Example of Java Bean Class
===========================
package mypack;  
public class Employee implements java.io.Serializable{  
    private int id;  
    private String name;  

    public Employee(){}  

    public void setId(int id){this.id=id;}  
    public int getId(){return id;}  
    public void setName(String name){this.name=name;}  
    public String getName(){return name;}  
}  

    package mypack;  
    public class Test{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Employee e=new Employee();//object is created  
    e.setName("Arjun");//setting value to the object  
    System.out.println(e.getName());  
    }}  

Another Example : if we want to pass information from Service layer to DAO layer to save information to database ,
in that case rather than passing all attributes through method paramers, we can pass just one object (java bean class)
and respective fields can be retrieved in the DAO layers if needed.

(1) Difference between POJO class and Bean class
Ans : Pojo class doesn't need to implement Serilizable .Rest aresame as java Beans class.
It can have only these :
1.No arg Constructor(user defined or compiler generated).
2.private and non-static member variable
2.public Accessors (Setters and Getters) for member variable
