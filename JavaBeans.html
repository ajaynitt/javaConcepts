#Java Bean
JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). 

A Java Bean is a java class that should follow following conventions:

    It should have a no-arg constructor.
    It should be Serializable.
    It should provide methods to set and get the values of the properties, known as getter and setter methods.

#Why use Java Bean?
According to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. 
A bean encapsulates many objects into one object, so we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, 
it provides the easy maintenance.
